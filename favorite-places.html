  <h1>Our <em>Favorite</em> Places</h1>
  <h2>Here are some of our <strong>favorite</strong> places!</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleakal%C4%81">Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii</h3>

  <p>Haleakala is certainly one of the most gorgeous views from anywhere on Maui.  The top of the volcano pops up above the clouds and it feels like you are in another world when at the summit.  We highly recommend that you visit this amazing landmark when you go to Maui!!!</p>
  <h3><a href="https://www.nps.gov/redw/index.htm">Redwood National Forest, CA</h3>

  <p>The Redwood National Forest in Northern California is one of the most spiritual places we have been to. You can feel the age an power iminating from the massive 1000+ year old trees. It is also incredibly peaceful and beautiful. For a place to reflect and release tension, in our opinion, would be a prime choice.</p>
